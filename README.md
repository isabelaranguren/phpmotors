# Phpmotors

This PHP project utilizes a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and implements user authentication using PHP. The project is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly interface for logging in and managing user accounts. 

The front-end of the application is built with HTML and CSS, while the back-end uses PHP to handle authentication and user management tasks, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions. 

The MVC architecture separates the code into three distinct sections, the model, the view, and the controller, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.
